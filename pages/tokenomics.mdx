## $MINT Staking & Restaking Mechanism

![CLI commands](/assets/tokenomics-4.png)

Mint Blockchain implements a decentralized distribution of rewards for network transaction ordering through the $MINT Staking & Restaking mechanism.

After the $MINT Token Generation Event (TGE), users will be able to participate in $MINT staking through the [MintPool](https://mintpool.mintchain.io/) protocol. MintPool is a decentralized staking protocol on the Mint Blockchain network, which supports the staking of $MINT, $ETH, and NFT assets.

After users stake $MINT, they will receive **staking certificates** called **sMINT Tokens** (Staked MINT Tokens).

Holding **sMINT** provides an **APR of 15%** in $MINT token mining rewards, funded by MintDAO.

Once users acquire **sMINT**, they can combine it into **BC721 Mint-eNFT** assets (the required amount of sMINT varies based on the **Bonding Curve**, adding an element of strategy and excitement). Holding a **BC721 Mint-eNFT** grants users **50% of Mint Blockchainâ€™s sequencer revenue** (after deducting DA fees and Superchain Profit Share) as mining rewards. This process can be understood as a **Restaking** operation for $MINT tokens.

The $MINT staking & restaking mechanism ensures predictable returns for the Mint community. Everyone starts earning a staking and restaking rewards ( $MINT & $ETH) everyday. The restaking mechanism leverages our innovative bounding curve, combined with Mint-eNFT assets. 

Through this mechanism, users can earn stable 15% APR rewards and have the right to share in the revenue of the whole network.
