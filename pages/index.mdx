## Background

According to NFTScan data, over the past four years, more than 2 billion NFTs have been minted across major blockchain networks, with the global market cap now reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. Currently, around 4,000 to 6,000 NFT projects are launched daily, contributing approximately 5 million new NFTs each day. NFTs are rapidly evolving as one of the most dynamic categories of crypto assets on the blockchain.

Compared to fungible tokens, NFTs offer superior scalability and programmability. NFT assets can embed richer metadata, enhancing the utility of blockchain ledgers and enabling the creation of more valuable on-chain assets. Meanwhile, NFTs have diverse applications across AI Agents, intellectual property (IP), Real-World Assets (RWA), AI-generated content (AIGC), music, ticketing, membership systems, reputation systems, digital identity, crypto art, gaming, entertainment, social interaction, and brand marketing. NFTs are set to revolutionize many Web2 industries, significantly improving operational efficiency and value capture.

On another level, NFTs, being more accessible and understandable, facilitate the global dissemination of decentralized and distributed blockchain concepts, promoting blockchain education and adoption worldwide. As a new class of crypto assets, NFTs will play a crucial role in this process.

During the past few years, our team identified several challenges in the NFT sector, such as low standardization of NFT assets, lack of liquidity, and chaotic data copyright management. These problems are likely to have a significant impact on the NFT industry and ecosystem, both now and in the future. Therefore, we have decided to build **Mint Blockchain**, providing developers with a secure, stable, decentralized network and an efficient, agile development environment.

Mint Blockchain aims to make NFTs the most valuable asset class in the crypto world, enabling everyone to own NFT assets and establishing NFTs as a free asset connecting humans and AI Agents.

## Mint Ecosystem Incentive Mechanism

To better promote the innovation of NFT asset protocols and consumer applications, Mint Blockchain introduces an incentive mechanism at the economic model level, focused on rewarding innovative asset protocol developers. The incentives will be funded by MintDAO. The details are as follows:

![CLI commands](/assets/incentive.png)

* **NFTs to Earn:** Encourages creators to create new NFT assets within the Mint ecosystem.
* **Mint Eco Fund:** Invests in and supports native applications and developer teams within the Mint ecosystem.
* **ETH Gas Rewards:** Rewards outstanding protocol standards and applications with ETH gas incentives.
* **RetroPGF Mechanism:** Offers long-term retroactive rewards to infrastructure builders of the Mint ecosystem.

## Mint Blockchain Tokenomics

Mint's native token, MINT, coordinates all the flow of value in the Mint ecosystem.

* **Token Name:** MINT  
* **Token Ticker:** $MINT  
* **Total Supply:** 1 Billion

### Mint Blockchain ($MINT) Token Distribution:

![CLI commands](/assets/token-dist.png)

**82% for community builders, early supporters, and ecosystem developers:**

* **MintDAO:** 50%
* **Launch Contributors:** 20%
* **Community Airdrop:** 12%

**18% for the MintCore team.**

### $MINT Token Utility:

$MINT performs several key functions within the Mint Blockchain ecosystem:

1. **Governance Rights:** $MINT holders have voting rights to participate in the governance of the Mint Blockchain network.
2. **Ecosystem Incentives:** $MINT is used to incentivize developers to build and contribute to the development of the Mint Blockchain ecosystem.
3. **Utility:** As the native cryptocurrency of Mint Blockchain, $MINT serves as the official asset for use within the network. It is the designated staking asset for Mint Blockchain validators.
4. **Asset Pricing:** $MINT is used for asset pricing and transaction pricing during the issuance of Real-World Asset (RWA), NFT, Token, Meme, and other assets on the Mint Blockchain network.

## MINT Staking & Restaking Mechanism

Mint Blockchain implements a decentralized distribution of rewards for network transaction ordering through the $MINT Staking & Restaking mechanism.

After the $MINT Token Generation Event (TGE), users will be able to participate in $MINT staking through the **MintPool** protocol. MintPool is a decentralized staking protocol on the Mint Blockchain network, which supports the staking of $MINT, $ETH, and NFT assets.

When users stake $MINT, they must choose a **Staking Node** for the staking operation. Staking Nodes can be classified into two types:

* **Super Node:** Super Nodes are initially evaluated based on reputation and require staking a certain amount of $MINT tokens to run a node server. Super Node members must actively contribute to the development of the Mint ecosystem and are typically made up of large infrastructure providers and investment organizations within the Mint ecosystem.
* **Base Node:** Base Nodes are community-driven nodes and are generally formed by the global Mint community and developer communities. Base Nodes are more open and have lower entry barriers, allowing any developer organization or crypto community to apply and join the Mint ecosystem. Both Super Nodes and Base Nodes can receive node mining rewards funded by MintDAO. The rewards are based on the amount of $MINT staked in each Staking Node, typically around 10% of the staking rewards that are additionally distributed to the Staking Nodes by MintDAO.

After users stake $MINT via a Staking Node, they will receive **staking certificates** called **sMINT Tokens** (Staked MINT Tokens).

Holding **sMINT** provides an **APR of 15%** in $MINT token mining rewards, funded by MintDAO.

Once users acquire **sMINT**, they can combine it into **BC721 Mint-eNFT** assets (the required amount of sMINT varies based on the Bonding Curve, adding an element of strategy and excitement). Holding a **BC721 Mint-eNFT** grants users **50% of Mint Blockchain’s sequencer revenue** (after deducting DA fees and Superchain fees) as mining rewards. This process can be understood as a **Restaking** operation for $MINT tokens.

![CLI commands](/assets/mint-staking.png)

### Summary of Earnings from $MINT Staking & Restaking:

Users participating in $MINT Staking & Restaking will gain **two layers of rewards**:

1. **First Layer:** An **APR of 15%** in $MINT as staking rewards.

2. **Second Layer: 50% of the net ETH earnings** from the Mint Blockchain’s sequencer revenue as Restaking rewards.

This Staking & Restaking mechanism greatly improves the capital efficiency of $MINT tokens, strengthens the security of the Mint Blockchain network, stabilizes the ecosystem’s economy, and decentralizes the distribution of network sequencer revenue rewards. It also enables the community to capture long-term benefits from the Mint Blockchain’s development, enhancing consensus within the community and promoting active participation in the ecosystem’s growth.

## MintDAO Organization

MintDAO is the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) within the Mint Blockchain ecosystem, managing 50% of the total $MINT supply through a multi-signature wallet. As the Mint ecosystem grows, the multi-signature authority of MintDAO will gradually be delegated to the core organizations and builders within the Mint ecosystem, aiming for decentralized governance of ecosystem development.

### Core Functions of MintDAO:

![CLI commands](/assets/mint-dao.png)

* **$MINT Basic Liquidity Provision:** MintDAO is responsible for providing early liquidity for the $MINT asset.
