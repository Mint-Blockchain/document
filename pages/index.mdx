From the first NFT standard of ERC721 introduced by the Ethereum community in 2017 to the present day, NFTs have been developed for 6 years. From the craze of CryptoKitties to the trend of CryptoPunks avatars, and now led by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) in the 2021 NFT Summer, we have seen the resilience and infinite scalability demonstrated by NFT in its historical development process. In the PFP NFT bull market of 2021, the market size reached billions of dollars, but for the entire NFT field, this is just the tip of the iceberg. 
**We believe that NFT will create a market worth trillions of dollars in the future, with infinite development prospects.**

In the past 3 years, the NFTScan Labs team has been deeply involved in the NFT field. We have been in contact with a large number of frontline developers and have researched thousands of NFT projects. 
**Throughout the process, we have discovered the high scalability and vast application space of NFT assets. We firmly believe that mass adoption in the crypto space will occur in the NFT field, unleashing a market size worth trillions of dollars.** 
To accelerate the arrival of this day, we have decided to launch a new blockchain in 2024: **Mint Blockchain**.

>**MintCore**: Organized by Mint Foundation, is the core development team responsible for the underlying technology selection and network development of Mint Blockchain. They also handle the development and maintenance of core components like cross-chain bridges and transaction sorters.
> 
>**NFTScan Labs**: NFTScan Labs, the developer team behind the blockchain infrastructure NFTScan, is also the core initiating team for Mint Blockchain. They focus on developing essential infrastructure for Mint Blockchain, including block explorers, NFT browsers, developer documentation systems, developer SDK tools, NFT software and hardware terminal operating systems, and more.
