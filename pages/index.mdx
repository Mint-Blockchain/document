# Mint Blockchain: The Future of NFTs

## Background

According to NFTScan data, over the past four years, more than 2 billion NFTs have been minted across major blockchain networks, with the global market cap now reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. Currently, around 4,000 to 6,000 NFT projects are launched daily, contributing approximately 5 million new NFTs each day. NFTs are rapidly evolving as one of the most dynamic categories of crypto assets on the blockchain.

Compared to fungible tokens, NFTs offer superior scalability and programmability. NFT assets can embed richer metadata, enhancing the utility of blockchain ledgers and enabling the creation of more valuable on-chain assets. Meanwhile, NFTs have diverse applications across AI Agents, intellectual property (IP), Real-World Assets (RWA), AI-generated content (AIGC), music, ticketing, membership systems, reputation systems, digital identity, crypto art, gaming, entertainment, social interaction, and brand marketing.

## Introduction to Mint Blockchain

Mint Blockchain is an Ethereum Layer2 network initiated by NFTScan Labs and the MintCore developer team, starting its development in October 2023. The mainnet launched in May 2024, marking the beginning of its ecosystem development phase.

Mint Blockchain is built on the OP Stack, positioning it as a native Layer2 solution and a core member of the Optimism Superchain. Its DA layer relies on the Ethereum mainnet, ensuring security through Ethereum’s consensus mechanism. Being fully EVM-compatible, Ethereum developers can seamlessly expand their projects onto Mint Blockchain.
